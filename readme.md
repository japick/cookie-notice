<h1>Simple web cookie notice</h1>
<p>This module is designed to be ported to your website for quick and easy integration. The cookie functionality is handled by a combination of <a href="https://github.com/js-cookie/js-cookie">js-cookie</a> and two jQuery functions.</p>
<p>It's completely bare-bones, so be sure to add your own styles/transitions.</p>
<p><i>Everyone loves a good cookie notice, right?</i></p>
